    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<h2>Requirements clarification</h2>\n<p>Requirements clarification turns a broad request into a design problem you can reason about. Before choosing a database or drawing services, establish who uses the system, what they need to accomplish, and which promises must survive load and failures.</p>\n<p>We will turn “design a URL shortener” into a small brief. The same questions apply to a feed, file store, or payment service; the answers will change.</p>\n<h3>Start with the people and the operation</h3>\n<p>A link creator submits a destination and receives a short address. A reader opens that address and expects to reach the destination. An administrator may need to disable an abusive link. These are three roles with different permissions, even if one person sometimes fills all three.</p>\n<p>Now follow the main operation. Can the creator choose the short name? Can its destination change? Must readers sign in? Each answer changes something the implementation must enforce.</p>\n<p>For this course's shortener, assume approved callers can create links, names are generated, destinations stay fixed, and anyone can follow a link. Custom aliases and destination editing are outside the first version. Abuse handling still needs an owner; leaving out editing does not make unsafe destinations harmless.</p>\n<p>Write these choices down as assumptions to confirm with the product owner. A plausible answer becomes a requirement only when the people responsible for the product agree to it.</p>\n<h3>Ask what must remain true</h3>\n<p>A generated name must not silently replace somebody else's mapping. A saved link must keep its destination through the promised retention period. These are <strong>invariants</strong>: conditions the implementation must preserve, including when requests overlap or are retried.</p>\n<p>Also identify the authoritative data. The stored mapping decides where a link goes. A cached copy can speed up reading it, but does not become a separate authority that may choose a different destination.</p>\n<p>Freshness needs its own question. If an administrator disables a link, how long may a cached copy still redirect readers? An acceptable delay of a minute permits different choices from a requirement to stop every new redirect immediately. Do not leave that promise hidden inside “we will cache it.”</p>\n<h3>Separate work that must finish now from work that can wait</h3>\n<p>“Record clicks” is ambiguous. Our server can record a redirect request; it cannot infer a distinct person or prove that the destination page loaded.</p>\n<p>The shortener exercise requires each accepted redirect request to have a stored event before the response. Reports may be calculated later. If storing the event fails, this version returns an error. That is a deliberate product tradeoff: event retention takes priority over redirect availability during that failure.</p>\n<p>Another product could choose to redirect anyway and tolerate missing events. The important question is which promise the design is supposed to keep. Moving report calculation into the background does not answer whether losing its input is acceptable.</p>\n<h3>Put numbers and boundaries in the brief</h3>\n<p>Keep these questions nearby when the conversation moves beyond the ordinary request:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Area</th><th>Question to settle</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scale</td><td>How many reads and writes arrive, how bursty are they, and in which regions?</td></tr><tr><td>Retention</td><td>How long must records remain, and what growth should we plan for?</td></tr><tr><td>Reliability</td><td>Which operations may degrade, and how quickly must service and data recover?</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Who can read each record, and which sensitive fields are actually needed?</td></tr><tr><td>Scope</td><td>Which workflows are required now, and which are explicitly deferred?</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>For the course exercise, use 100 million redirects and 1 million new links per day, with mappings retained for at least five years. These are planning assumptions, not measured traffic. <a href=\"/wiki/back-of-the-envelope-capacity-planning\">Capacity planning</a> turns them into rates and storage estimates.</p>\n<p>Before handing off the brief, check one failure: the analytics report is unavailable, but event storage works. Should redirects continue? Yes, under our chosen contract. Now make event storage unavailable. The answer changes. Being able to explain that difference means the requirements are specific enough to guide a design.</p>\n<p>Targets such as “fast” and “highly available” still need a measurement and a time window. <a href=\"/wiki/non-functional-requirements\">Non-functional requirements</a> makes those promises testable.</p>\n</div>",

It helps answer a practical question: when a product rule or external provider changes, which code should need to change with it?</p>\n<p>We will separate the shortener's HTTP handling, link rules, and storage work, then check whether those boundaries make a change easier to test.</p>\n<h3>Give each responsibility an owner</h3>\n<p>A route handler can parse a request, run SQL, check whether a link is disabled, record a click, and format the redirect. For a small operation, that can be readable. Trouble starts when an import job needs the same rules, or every handler begins interpreting database rows differently.</p>\n<p>Separate the work when those responsibilities need to vary independently:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Responsibility</th><th>What it owns</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HTTP adapter</td><td>Parse the request and translate the result into an HTTP response</td></tr><tr><td>Link operation</td><td>Apply the product's rules for creating or opening a link</td></tr><tr><td>Storage adapter</td><td>Execute queries and map stored records into the application's result types</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>A <strong>boundary</strong> is the agreement between these parts. It can be an ordinary function call inside one process. Drawing separate boxes does not require separate servers or deployments.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">mermaid\nflowchart TB\n  accTitle: Two callers share the same link rules\n  accDescr: HTTP handling and an import job call link operations, which use a storage adapter. These are application responsibilities, not separate machines.\n  HTTP[HTTP handling] --> Rules[Link operations]\n  Import[Import job] --> Rules\n  Rules --> Storage[Storage adapter]\n  Storage --> DB[(Database)]</code></pre>\n<p>The HTTP path creates one link; the import job may create many. Both must enforce the same rule that a generated code cannot replace an existing mapping. The database's uniqueness constraint enforces the collision rule atomically; the application decides whether to retry with another candidate or return an error.</p>\n<h3>Make the agreement useful to its caller</h3>\n<p>Consider <code>resolve(code)</code>. “Returns a URL” leaves several cases unstated. The link might be absent, disabled, or temporarily impossible to look up.</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Result</th><th>Meaning</th><th>HTTP caller's action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Found</td><td>The operation permits this link and supplies its destination</td><td>Continue the redirect path</td></tr><tr><td>Missing</td><td>The lookup succeeded, but no mapping exists</td><td>Return not found</td></tr><tr><td>Disabled</td><td>The mapping exists but cannot be used</td><td>Refuse the redirect</td></tr><tr><td>Unavailable</td><td>The operation could not establish an answer</td><td>Return a service error</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Keep unavailable distinct from missing. Translating a connection failure into “no such link” gives the caller a false answer. Likewise, the storage adapter should not leak a vendor-specific exception into every route and job that uses it.</p>\n<p>For the shortener's agreed contract, a successful redirect also waits for its request event to be stored. That sequencing belongs to the link operation. HTTP formatting does not decide whether losing a click is acceptable.</p>\n<h3>Test the rule through the boundary</h3>\n<p>To test “disabled links never redirect,” supply a small in-memory storage implementation that returns a disabled record. Exercise the link operation directly. The test should not need a browser, a live database, or knowledge of SQL syntax to check that product rule.</p>\n<p>That test does not establish that the real database query works. Test the storage adapter against the database separately, including missing rows, uniqueness conflicts, and failures. Keeping these tests distinct helps identify whether a failure comes from a rule or its persistence implementation.</p>\n<p>The same approach applies to a payment or notification provider: expose the operation the application needs, then translate it to the provider's API in one place. A replacement provider may have different guarantees, so an interface reduces the places to inspect; it does not make providers automatically interchangeable.</p>\n<h3>Stop before the boundary becomes ceremony</h3>\n<p>A function that forwards unchanged arguments through three layers is not necessarily protecting anything. Introduce a boundary around a repeated rule, a dependency that changes, or a decision worth testing independently.</p>\n<p>Review a likely change: add an import job, replace a notification provider, or introduce link expiry. If each requires edits across unrelated route handlers, the rule probably has no clear owner. If one focused operation owns the change and its tests, the logical design is doing useful work.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/repository-pattern\">repository pattern</a> develops the storage boundary further. <a href=\"/wiki/monolith-vs-microservices\">Monoliths and microservices</a> asks a separate question: which of these responsibilities need independent deployment?</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<h2>Non-functional requirements</h2>\n<p>Non-functional requirements describe the conditions a system must meet while doing its job: latency, throughput, availability, durability, consistency, security, cost, and operability. “The API works” is incomplete if it becomes unusably slow under the expected load.</p>\n<p>The useful habit is to turn each vague expectation into something a test or production measurement can check. We will write a latency target, separate availability from recovery, and see how those targets affect the design.</p>\n<h3>Say what you measure</h3>\n<p>“The API should be fast” leaves several questions open. Which operation? How much traffic? How many slow requests are acceptable? Are we timing the database, the server, or the user's browser?</p>\n<p>These are example targets to negotiate, not universal defaults:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Expectation</th><th>A more useful target</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fast reads</td><td>At least 95% of eligible reads return the correct result within 50 ms at the server boundary under the stated peak load</td></tr><tr><td>High throughput</td><td>Sustain 10,000 writes per second; handle a 50,000-per-second burst lasting five minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Available API</td><td>99.9% of eligible requests succeed over a stated monthly window</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable data</td><td>After the specified disaster, lose no more than five minutes of writes and restore service within 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Fresh search</td><td>99% of committed documents become searchable within 30 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The numbers do not finish the requirement. Define eligible requests, the observation window, and the failure conditions. A traffic test also needs realistic request sizes and a read/write mix; tiny requests at an idle database cannot establish performance for a busy product.</p>\n<p>Our shortener exercise uses a different provisional latency limit: one second for at least 95% of eligible redirects at the app boundary, including its required event write. Keep that exercise assumption separate from the 50 ms example above.</p>\n<h3>Count slow and failed requests honestly</h3>\n<p>The 95th percentile, or p95, describes the point below which 95% of the measured response times fall. It says nothing about how bad the slowest 5% can be. A fast average can hide that tail.</p>\n<p>For a user-facing target, count requests that produce the correct answer within the deadline. Failed or timed-out eligible attempts are misses, even if the server returned an error quickly. Otherwise, a failing service can appear to improve its latency.</p>\n<p>Choose the measurement boundary deliberately. Server logs help explain application work, but omit a request that cannot reach the server. Browser measurements include more of the user's experience and also depend on network conditions. Keep the two measurements labeled; a database timing is not a page-load promise.</p>\n<h3>Separate availability, data loss, and recovery time</h3>\n<p>Availability asks whether an operation is usable. Durability asks whether acknowledged data survives. A service can answer requests while having lost yesterday's records, or retain every record while temporarily unable to serve them.</p>\n<p>Recovery targets make a failure scenario concrete. The <strong>recovery point objective</strong>, RPO, limits the acceptable gap in recovered data, expressed in time. The <strong>recovery time objective</strong>, RTO, limits how long restoring service may take. Name the scenario and when the clock starts: a process restart, a lost disk, and a lost region require different recovery plans.</p>\n<p>Availability percentages also need a denominator. In a simplified time-based model where a service is either fully up or fully down, 99.9% availability over 30 days permits:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"\">text\n30 × 24 × 60 minutes × 0.001 = 43.2 minutes down</code></pre>\n<p>A request-based target instead counts successful attempts. An outage during the busiest minute can affect far more requests than one during a quiet minute, so the two percentages are not interchangeable.</p>\n<h3>Let the target change the design</h3>\n<p>Stricter freshness can rule out serving an old replica on a critical path. A shorter recovery target may require a ready replacement instead of rebuilding after failure. Both choices add work and cost that should follow an agreed product need.</p>\n<p>Include the other operating constraints too: tenant access rules, which data may be logged, a spending limit, and the signals an on-call engineer needs to diagnose failure. A design that meets latency while leaking another tenant's records has not met its requirements.</p>\n<p>Before accepting a target, ask how you will verify it. A recovery drill can test restoration; a realistic load test can test a throughput condition; neither proves a month of production availability. <a href=\"/wiki/availability-durability-consistency-cost\">Availability, durability, consistency, and cost</a> examines how these promises interact.</p>\n</div>",

We will work through one cache decision, then use the same method on other common choices.</p>\n<h3>Compare two answers to the same requirement</h3>\n<p>Suppose a product page repeatedly loads a seller's display name. Reading the database each time keeps the path simple. Caching the name can avoid repeated database work, but an edit may take time to appear wherever the cached value is used.</p>\n<p>First ask whether that delay is acceptable. If the product allows a briefly outdated display name, an expiry or invalidation policy can be part of the design. If the requirement says every read must reflect a completed edit, a cache that can serve an old value does not meet it.</p>\n<p>Now change the field from display name to “this seller may accept payments.” A stale answer can permit an operation that should have been stopped. Similar data shapes do not imply similar correctness requirements.</p>\n<p>Write the decision in a form another engineer can challenge:</p>\n<blockquote>Cache seller display names to reduce repeated reads.

If workers cannot keep up, the waiting time grows. Similarly, adding a metric label containing every user ID can make a small set of measurements expand with the user population. The cost follows the behavior, not the number of boxes in the drawing.</p>\n<p>These are possibilities to investigate, not universal verdicts. A cache with few hits may add work. Services with shared release dependencies may still have to deploy together.

    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<h2>Availability, durability, consistency, cost</h2>\n<p>A service can keep answering requests while losing saved data. It can also preserve every record while being temporarily unreachable. Availability, durability, consistency, and cost describe different properties; saying a system is “reliable” does not tell us which of them it provides.</p>\n<p>We will follow a newly created short link through three failures, then account for the work needed to prevent or recover from each one.</p>\n<h3>Can the reader use the link now?</h3>\n<p>Suppose the shortener's database is stopped. Its files are intact, but the application cannot look up a destination. The redirect path is unavailable even though the mapping has not been lost.</p>\n<p>Availability belongs to a particular operation. The reporting page can be down while redirects work, or creation can fail while existing links still resolve. Measure the paths that matter to users instead of treating an answering process as proof that the whole product works.</p>\n<p>Dependencies affect this promise. Our shortener requires an accepted redirect event to be stored before returning success. If the mapping can be read but that event cannot be stored, this design returns an error. Letting the redirect continue would improve availability during that failure, but would change the agreed event-retention requirement.</p>\n<h3>Will an acknowledged mapping survive?</h3>\n<p>The creator receives a successful response, then the application process crashes. The saved mapping must remain after restart. <strong>Durability</strong> concerns whether acknowledged data survives the failures the system claims to tolerate.</p>\n<p>The application must wait for the database's commit acknowledgement before promising that creation succeeded. That acknowledgement still depends on the database configuration and storage honoring durable writes. Data left only in volatile memory cannot survive losing that memory.</p>\n<p>A process restart with intact storage is different from destruction of the only disk. Surviving disk loss requires a recoverable copy elsewhere. A replica can help, but may also copy an accidental deletion; a backup and a tested restore procedure address a different recovery need.</p>\n<p>Name the failure you tested. “The record survived a restart” is useful evidence. It does not establish recovery from a lost region or from an operator deleting the record.</p>\n<h3>What may the next read observe?</h3>\n<p>Now creation succeeds, but the creator immediately follows the short link through a replica that has not received the new mapping. It returns “unknown code.” The data may be durable on the writer, yet the read violates the user's expectation.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency</strong> describes the rules relating reads and writes, including their visibility and ordering. For this path, the concrete requirement is that a read started after successful creation can find the valid mapping. An immutable destination does not remove this first-read problem.</p>\n<p>A straightforward initial choice is to read from the database that accepted the creation. In PostgreSQL's default Read Committed isolation, a new ordinary query sees rows committed before that query began. A lagging replica or an older transaction snapshot needs separate consideration.</p>\n<p>A report can have a looser freshness requirement. It may omit recent events while the calculation catches up, even though those events are safely stored. <a href=\"/wiki/consistency-models\">Consistency models</a> develops these guarantees without treating every operation as having the same needs.</p>\n<h3>What does keeping those promises cost?</h3>\n<p>Waiting for commits adds work to the request path. Extra copies consume storage and network capacity. Failover and restoration need tests, monitoring, and people who can operate them.</p>\n<p>Use four questions when reviewing a proposed saving:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Availability</td><td>Which operations can continue during the specified failure?</td></tr><tr><td>Durability</td><td>Which acknowledged records can be lost?</td></tr><tr><td>Consistency</td><td>Which old, missing, or conflicting results may a reader observe?</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td>What resources and operating work does the design require?</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Removing the shortener's event write makes a redirect cheaper by dropping a promise. Moving report calculation out of that request removes work that never had to finish synchronously. These are different kinds of saving.</p>\n<p>A higher uptime percentage cannot compensate for losing records the product must retain. Choose the required behavior first, then use <a href=\"/wiki/cost-aware-architecture\">cost-aware architecture</a> to compare ways of providing it.</p>\n</div>",

Fetching each item with a separate database query would produce roughly 460,000 lookups per second at the assumed peak, before retries or cache misses. That estimate is a reason to inspect batching and query shape; it does not by itself prove that any particular database cannot cope.</p>\n<p>Separate reads, writes, background jobs, and fanout. One new post can cause many feed updates. One redirect in our shortener also writes an event, so a product with many more reads than creations is not necessarily read-heavy at the database.</p>\n<p>Bandwidth needs bytes as well as requests. At an illustrative 20 kB response payload, 23,000 feed responses per second carry about 460 MB/s, or 3.7 Gbit/s, before protocol overhead. These decimal units describe payload leaving that serving boundary; compression, caches, and network placement change what each link carries.</p>\n<p>Keep the latency target beside the rate. “Handles 23,000 requests per second” is not sufficient if the queue grows throughout the test and users wait longer each minute.</p>\n<h3>Build storage from retention and representation</h3>\n<p>For a steady write rate, start with:</p>\n<p><strong>Retained records = records per day × retention days.</strong></p>\n<p>Multiply by the stored bytes per record, then account for indexes, replicas, derived data, backups, write logs, and temporary space. Do not add an index allowance twice if your measured record size already includes it.</p>\n<p>The shortener exercise assumes 1 million new links per day, retained for five 365-day years. That gives 1.825 billion links. An initial allowance of 500 bytes per link, including indexes, projects 0.9125 decimal TB for that one copy of the link data.</p>\n<p>Click history is separate and may dominate. At 100 million redirects per day, the shortener records 100 times as many redirect events as new links. The event size and retention period need their own estimate.</p>\n<h3>Replace the assumptions that matter most</h3>\n<p>A local PostgreSQL 16.10 capture on 11 September 2026 measured a million-row shortener fixture. Its link table's main data fork occupied 93,085,696 bytes and its indexes 44,974,080 bytes: about 138.1 bytes per link together. That measure excludes auxiliary storage and the rest of the database.</p>\n<p>Using the rounded 138.1 bytes in the same projection gives about 0.252 TB, roughly 3.6 times smaller than the initial link allowance. It remains a projection: longer URLs, extra indexes, growth, and deleted-row space can change the future representation. It is not the total disk requirement or a predicted invoice.</p>\n<p>The same historical test completed 231,377 warm indexed lookups in 20 seconds at a target arrival rate of about 11,574 per second. None failed, were skipped, or exceeded its chosen one-second limit. It used a local socket and excluded the application and required event insert. It supports testing the simple design further; it does not establish capacity for the complete five-year service.</p>\n<p>Finish the estimate by naming the next limiting resource: CPU, database writes, cache memory, queue processing, bandwidth, or a provider quota.

    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<h2>How a server handles many requests</h2>\n<p>Concurrency lets several tasks make progress during overlapping periods. Parallelism means computations run at the same time on different execution resources. A server can handle many waiting requests concurrently while only one CPU core executes its application code.</p>\n<p>The distinction helps you choose between overlapping waits, adding compute capacity, and limiting the amount of work in flight. We will separate those choices using a small request timeline.</p>\n<h3>Separate computing from waiting</h3>\n<p>Assume each request needs 5 ms of CPU work, waits 40 ms for a database result, then needs another 1 ms of CPU work to respond. These are teaching values, not measurements of a real endpoint.</p>\n<p>A server that finishes each request before starting the next spends 46 ms per request. Sixteen requests arriving together take 16 × 46 = 736 ms to finish. Its CPU does only 96 ms of application work during that period; the rest is waiting.</p>\n<p>Another request could use the CPU while the first waits. Overlapping those waits reduces the time needed to finish the batch without making any individual database operation faster.</p>\n<div class=\"interactive-placeholder\">Start with 16 requests and compare the three handling models. Watch both the request timelines and the CPU row. Then increase the burst to 64 requests.\n<p></div></p>\n<h3>Two ways to overlap the waits</h3>\n<p>A <strong>thread pool</strong> gives several requests their own execution context. When one thread blocks on I/O, another can run. A cap bounds the number of requests holding worker slots; requests beyond that cap must wait or be refused.</p>\n<p>An <strong>event loop</strong> starts a non-blocking operation and resumes the request when its result is ready. A request waiting on network I/O does not need to occupy a separate application thread for the entire wait. The loop can work on another ready request meanwhile.</p>\n<p>In this model, the eight-worker pool finishes 16 requests in 134 ms; the event-loop model finishes them in 121 ms. The difference comes from the model's admission cap and scheduling, not a universal speed advantage of event loops. Both still perform 96 ms of CPU work on one core.</p>\n<p>A long CPU computation on the event-loop thread prevents its other callbacks from running. Declaring a function <code>async</code> does not move that computation to another processor. In Node.js, some platform operations use a worker pool; application CPU work still needs an explicit strategy such as worker threads, separate processes, or small chunks that yield.</p>\n<h3>Add parallelism when computing is the limit</h3>\n<p>For 64 requests, the model needs 64 × 6 = 384 ms of CPU work. Its event-loop result reaches that floor: the single core is continuously busy. Adding more waiting requests cannot make that core execute the same instructions sooner.</p>\n<p>To reduce the computing time, reduce the work or spread independent work across additional cores. Shared state, coordination, and uneven task sizes can limit the gain, so twice as many workers does not promise twice the throughput.</p>\n<p>Runtime details matter. In a conventional CPython build with the global interpreter lock enabled, Python bytecode does not execute in parallel across its threads. Threads can still overlap I/O; processes, native code that releases the lock, and optional free-threaded builds have different behavior. “Threads never run in parallel” is not a general rule.</p>\n<h3>Bound the work your dependencies receive</h3>\n<p>Overlapping waits is useful only while the dependency can support the resulting load. More requests in flight can increase database contention, hold more connections, consume memory, and make every request wait longer.</p>\n<p>Budget concurrency across application instances. If each of ten instances may hold eight database connections, that is up to 80 connections before counting background workers and administrative access. A per-process cap is not a system-wide cap.</p>\n<p>The model above holds database wait time fixed. Real dependencies often slow down as load rises, so its numbers illustrate scheduling rather than predict production throughput. Use measurements to choose limits, and use <a href=\"/wiki/backpressure\">backpressure</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/load-shedding\">load shedding</a> when incoming work exceeds them.</p>\n</div>",

Hardware Limits vs. Distributed Complexity</h3>\n      <p>Vertical scaling upgrades existing nodes (e.g., transitioning an instance from 8 cores to 128 cores). It requires zero application code refactoring and introduces no distributed network latency. However, it hits a ceiling: the largest machine or instance size available, with diminishing returns from NUMA memory-node crossing penalties and memory bandwidth, and price premiums at the largest or specialised sizes (within an instance family, cloud pricing is roughly linear per vCPU). Furthermore, taking the single machine down for hardware maintenance produces instantaneous total outage unless paired with a hot standby.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Stateless Tiering as the Prerequisite for Scale-Out</h3>\n      <p>Horizontal scaling adds commodity nodes behind a load balancer. It offers far more headroom and fault tolerance, although shared state, coordination and hot keys keep real gains below linear—if a worker node dies, health checks drop it from the pool without user impact. However, horizontal scaling requires the application tier to be strictly <strong>stateless</strong>: user sessions, in-flight jobs, and persistent data must move to external shared state layers (Redis clusters, distributed relational databases, or object stores).</p>\n\n      <h3>3. The Hybrid Modern Standard</h3>\n      <p>Production systems rarely pick one dogmatically. Modern engineering pairs vertical optimization with horizontal elasticity: right-size individual nodes for the workload (for latency-sensitive services, fitting within one NUMA node avoids cross-socket memory penalties, but the right size is workload dependent), then scale those standardized units horizontally behind load balancers.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: when to scale up and when to scale out</h2>\n<p>Suppose an API tier handles 2,000 requests per second at peak, and load tests show one 8 vCPU instance sustains about 600 requests per second at 60% CPU while meeting the latency target. Traffic is expected to triple within a year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Today:</strong> 2,000 / 600 is about 3.4, so 4 instances meet peak. To survive losing one instance (N+1) you run 5.</li>\n<li><strong>Next year:</strong> 6,000 / 600 = 10 instances, 11 with one spare. The load balancer, health checks and deployment pipeline do not change; only the instance count does.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertical alternative:</strong> one 64 vCPU instance might handle about 4,000 to 4,500 requests per second (rarely a perfect 8x, due to lock contention and memory bandwidth). It is simpler, but it is still a single point of failure, and a restart for patching is a full outage unless a second machine stands by.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The database behind it is a different story. If each request makes one indexed read, 6,000 reads per second is well within a single well-provisioned PostgreSQL or MySQL primary with read replicas. Scaling the database vertically first, then adding read replicas, then partitioning only when writes or data size demand it, is the standard progression.</p>\n<h2>Trade-off table</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Dimension</th><th>Vertical (scale up)</th><th>Horizontal (scale out)</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Code changes</td><td>Usually none</td><td>Tier must be stateless or state must be partitioned</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Failure impact</td><td>One machine failure is a full outage unless a standby exists</td><td>Losing one of N nodes removes about 1/N of capacity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Ceiling</td><td>Largest available instance size</td><td>Coordination and shared dependencies, not machine size</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cost curve</td><td>Roughly linear per vCPU within an instance family, jumps at the largest or specialised sizes</td><td>Linear in node count plus load balancer and operational overhead</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Upgrades</td><td>Resize often requires a restart</td><td>Rolling replacement with no downtime</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Best fit</td><td>Databases, early-stage systems, workloads needing large shared memory</td><td>Stateless web and API tiers, workers, caches with partitioning</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Failure modes to watch</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hidden state:</strong> local file uploads, in-memory rate limit counters or caches that assume one node silently become wrong with several nodes.</li>\n<li><strong>Thundering scale-out:</strong> an autoscaler that adds 20 instances at once can open 20 new connection pools against the database and overload it.</li>\n<li><strong>Uneven load:</strong> long-lived connections (WebSockets) stay on old nodes after scale-out, so new nodes sit idle until connections are rebalanced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How real systems do it</h2>\n<p>Stack Overflow famously served very high traffic for years from a small number of powerful SQL Server machines, a deliberate vertical choice for the database. Most large web companies run stateless application tiers behind load balancers and autoscaling groups, and keep sessions in a shared store such as Redis or in signed tokens so any node can serve any user.</p>\n</div>",

The Distributed Network Tax</h3>\n      <p>In a monolith, calling from the order module to the payment module is an in-process function call costing nanoseconds to microseconds. In microservices, that call crosses TCP network boundaries, introducing serialization overhead (JSON/Protobuf), connection management, service discovery (DNS lookups are normally cached, not per call), TLS encryption, and non-deterministic packet latency. Every inter-service hop increases the p99 tail latency budget.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Data Consistency: ACID vs. Eventual Consistency (Sagas)</h3>\n      <p>Monoliths enforce consistency through ACID database transactions with atomic rollbacks. When services split databases, cross-service atomic transactions require a distributed commit protocol such as Two-Phase Commit, which is rarely used between services because it blocks when the coordinator fails. The common alternative is a Saga (orchestrated or choreographed) with compensating transactions, which provides eventual consistency rather than atomicity: intermediate states are visible and compensations can fail.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. A Common Default: Modular Monolith First</h3>\n      <p>Unless multiple independent engineering teams are stepping on each other's release cadence, start with a <strong>Modular Monolith</strong>. Enforce strict package boundaries with clean interfaces in a single codebase. Only carve out a microservice when a specific sub-domain requires distinct hardware scaling (e.g., GPU video processing) or independent compliance isolation.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: the cost of one extra hop</h2>\n<p>Consider a checkout request that, in a monolith, calls the order module, inventory module and payment module in process. Each call costs microseconds. Split into services, each call becomes a network round trip. Inside one data centre a small RPC typically costs around 0.5 to 2 ms including serialization, so three sequential calls add roughly 2 to 6 ms at the median. That sounds small, but the tail compounds.</p>\n<p>If each service independently meets its latency target 99% of the time, a request that must call all three sequentially meets it only about 0.99 x 0.99 x 0.99 = 97% of the time. Availability multiplies the same way: three dependencies at 99.9% each give at most about 99.7% for the combined path, before counting the caller's own failures. This is why microservice systems need timeouts, retries with budgets, circuit breakers and good tracing from day one.</p>\n<p>Data consistency changes too. In the monolith, \"create order and reserve stock\" is one database transaction. Across services it becomes a saga: order service writes a pending order and publishes an event, inventory reserves stock and publishes a result, and a failure triggers a compensating \"cancel order\". The user can briefly see a pending order that later disappears; the design must decide whether that is acceptable.</p>\n<h2>Trade-off table</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Concern</th><th>Modular monolith</th><th>Microservices</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Deploying one change</td><td>Redeploy the whole application</td><td>Deploy one service independently</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-module call</td><td>In-process function call</td><td>Network call with latency, partial failure and versioning</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions</td><td>Single database ACID transaction</td><td>Sagas, outbox pattern, eventual consistency</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Scaling</td><td>Scale the whole app together</td><td>Scale hot services separately, for example GPU transcoding</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fault isolation</td><td>A memory leak or bad deploy affects everything</td><td>Failures can be contained if timeouts and bulkheads exist</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Operational load</td><td>One pipeline, one set of dashboards</td><td>Per-service pipelines, tracing, service discovery, on-call</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Refactoring boundaries</td><td>Move code between packages</td><td>Migrate data and APIs between services</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Signals that a split is justified</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Several teams block each other on a shared release train, and the conflicting code has a clear domain boundary.</li>\n<li>One component has very different resource needs or scaling patterns, such as video transcoding or ML inference.</li>\n<li>A component needs a separate security or compliance boundary, such as card data handling under PCI DSS.</li>\n<li>A component's failure should not take down the rest, and you are prepared to make callers tolerate its absence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How real systems do it</h2>\n<p>Shopify runs one of the largest Ruby on Rails applications as a modular monolith, enforcing component boundaries with tooling rather than splitting into services.

The Leaky Abstraction Problem</h3>\n      <p>A frequent anti-pattern is creating a generic <code>Repository&lt;T&gt;</code> that exposes direct query builders, raw IQueryable, or arbitrary predicate filters to the service tier. When service code passes database-specific filter clauses into the repository, the abstraction leaks completely: database schema knowledge bleeds across domain boundaries, defeating the purpose of the pattern.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. The N+1 Query Trap & Impedance Mismatch</h3>\n      <p>Domain entities often possess nested relationships (e.g., an <code>Order</code> contains multiple <code>OrderItems</code>). Naive repository methods like <code>getOrderById(id)</code> that lazily fetch associated entities trigger classic N+1 network roundtrips to the database. Production repositories explicitly define aggregate root queries (e.g., <code>getOrderWithItems(id)</code>) that execute explicit SQL joins.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. CQRS Boundary: Reads vs. Writes</h3>\n      <p>Repositories shine for write-heavy domain aggregates enforcing business invariants. For complex read-heavy dashboard queries or multi-table analytical joins, bypassing the repository in favor of a specialized Read Model (CQRS) avoids inflating domain entities with unnecessary read projections.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: a link repository</h2>\n<p>For the course's URL shortener, the link operation needs only three storage capabilities. Defining them explicitly keeps the contract small:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>findByCode(code)</code> returns Found(link), Missing, or throws StorageUnavailable.</li>\n<li><code>insertIfAbsent(link)</code> returns Inserted or CodeTaken. The Postgres adapter implements this with <code>INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (code) DO NOTHING</code> and checks the affected row count, so the uniqueness rule stays atomic in the database.</li>\n<li><code>disable(code)</code> returns Updated or Missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The in-memory implementation is a dictionary plus the same result types. A unit test can run thousands of \"generate code, collide, retry\" cycles in well under a second. A separate integration test runs the Postgres adapter against a real database (for example in a container) and verifies that two concurrent <code>insertIfAbsent</code> calls with the same code produce exactly one Inserted and one CodeTaken.</p>\n<p>Notice what the interface does not offer: no <code>query(sql)</code>, no generic filter object.

While allowing infinite runtime attribute creation, querying multiple attributes requires repeated self-joins, forfeits native foreign-key constraints, and degrades database query planners. JSONB columns or dedicated document stores are usually a better choice; keep EAV for rare cases such as extremely sparse, user-defined attributes where JSON is unavailable.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. The Expand-Migrate-Contract Pattern</h3>\n      <p>Never rename or remove columns in a single deployment. Step 1 (Expand): Add the new nullable column alongside the old. Step 2: Update application code to dual-write to both columns while still reading from the old one. Step 3 (Migrate): Backfill historical rows asynchronously in batches, verify the backfill, then switch reads to the new column. Step 4 (Contract): Remove the old column once all dependent code is retired.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: renaming a column with expand/contract</h2>\n<p>Suppose the <code>links</code> table has a column <code>url</code> that should become <code>destination_url</code>, with 1.8 billion rows and continuous traffic. A single <code>RENAME</code> would break every running instance that still uses the old name. Instead:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expand:</strong> add <code>destination_url</code> as a nullable column. In PostgreSQL 11 and later, adding a nullable column (or one with a constant default) is a fast metadata-only change.</li>\n<li><strong>Dual-write:</strong> deploy code that writes both columns but still reads <code>url</code>. New rows are now complete in both.</li>\n<li><strong>Backfill:</strong> copy old rows in batches, for example 10,000 rows per transaction by primary key range. At about 2,000 batches per minute that is roughly 20 million rows per minute, so 1.8 billion rows takes around 90 minutes, throttled to keep replication lag low.</li>\n<li><strong>Switch reads:</strong> once the backfill is verified (count of rows where the columns differ is zero), deploy code that reads <code>destination_url</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Contract:</strong> stop writing <code>url</code>, wait until no running version uses it, then drop it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every step is independently deployable and reversible until the final drop. Tools such as pgroll, gh-ost (MySQL) and pt-online-schema-change automate parts of this.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a flexibility pattern</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Good for</th><th>Costs</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Typed columns</td><td>Data that is always present, filtered, joined or constrained</td><td>Schema migration for every change</td></tr>\n<tr><td>JSON or JSONB column</td><td>Per-tenant custom fields, third-party payloads, sparse product attributes</td><td>Weaker typing; indexes needed per access path; validation in application or check constraints</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Entity-Attribute-Value table</td><td>Extremely sparse attributes defined at runtime by users, when JSON is unavailable</td><td>Self-joins per attribute, all values stored as text, no per-attribute constraints</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Single table with type discriminator</td><td>A few subtypes sharing most fields</td><td>Many nullable columns as subtypes diverge</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table per subtype</td><td>Subtypes with distinct required fields and constraints</td><td>Joins or unions to query across all types</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Indexing flexible data in PostgreSQL</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A GIN index on a JSONB column supports containment queries such as <code>attributes @&gt; '{\"color\": \"red\"}'</code>.</li>\n<li>For one frequently filtered key, an expression index on <code>(attributes -&gt;&gt; 'color')</code> or a generated column with a B-tree index is usually smaller and faster.</li>\n<li>MySQL stores JSON in a binary format but has no GIN; index JSON values through generated columns or multi-valued indexes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Failure modes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Backfills that run too fast cause replica lag and lock contention; throttle and monitor.</li>\n<li>Dropping the old column while an old deploy or a batch job still reads it causes errors; check query logs first.</li>\n<li>JSON attributes that become business-critical should be promoted to real columns with the same expand/contract steps.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n      <h2>Under the Hood: Cloud Economics as a Primary Constraint</h2>\n      <p>In cloud-native distributed systems, architectural decisions map directly to recurring monthly operational expense. An architecture that achieves single-digit millisecond latency by over-provisioning memory clusters or continuously replicating terabytes across availability zones without considering network egress is functionally flawed. <strong>Cost-Aware Architecture</strong> establishes unit economics (e.g., compute and bandwidth cost per active user or per transaction) as a first-class engineering metric.</p>\n\n      <h2>Cloud Cost Levers Breakdown</h2>\n      <div class=\"mermaid\">\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph IngressEgress [\"Network Transfer\"]\n      E1[\"Internet Outbound Egress: Expensive ($0.08 - $0.12 / GB)\"]\n      E2[\"Cross-AZ Traffic: Hidden Cost ($0.01 / GB each way)\"]\n      E3[\"Intra-AZ Private IP: Free ($0.00 / GB)\"]\n    end\n    subgraph StorageCompute [\"Compute & Storage Tiering\"]\n      C1[\"Spot / Preemptible: 60-90% Discount\"]\n      C2[\"Reserved / Savings Plans: 30-50% Discount\"]\n      S1[\"S3 Standard -> Infrequent Access -> Glacier Archival\"]\n    end\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Production Cost Optimization Mechanics</h2>\n      <h3>1. The Cross-Availability-Zone Network Trap</h3>\n      <p>Engineers often assume intra-cloud network traffic is free. Cloud providers charge for cross-AZ data transfer in both directions. If microservice A in AZ-1 calls database replica B in AZ-2 with uncompressed gigabytes of JSON data, the monthly network transfer bill can eclipse compute costs. Mitigate this with AZ-affinity routing, gzip/Zstandard compression, and binary serialization (Protobuf).</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Multi-Tiered Storage Lifecycle Automation</h3>\n      <p>For many workloads, access frequency drops sharply with age and most reads target recent data (measure your own access pattern, for example with S3 Storage Class Analysis). Retaining multi-year logs, raw user uploads, or audit events in hot object storage (S3 Standard) wastes capital. Automated lifecycle rules transition data from Standard ($0.023/GB/mo) to Infrequent Access ($0.0125/GB/mo) to Glacier Deep Archive ($0.00099/GB/mo) (us-east-1 list prices, which vary by region and change over time). That cuts the per-GB storage price by over 95% for rarely read data, but retrieval fees and minimum storage durations (30 days for Standard-IA, 180 days for Deep Archive) apply.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. Compute Blending: On-Demand vs. Spot Capacity</h3>\n      <p>Stateless batch processors, asynchronous queue workers, and data analytics pipelines are good candidates for Spot capacity instead of full-price On-Demand instances. Blending an On-Demand baseline (for example around 20%) with Spot capacity for the rest, diversified across instance types behind auto-scaling groups, cuts compute spend while tolerating preemptions; the right split depends on the workload.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: pricing the shortener's traffic</h2>\n<p>Use illustrative AWS us-east-1 list prices (they change; always check the current pricing page): internet data transfer out about 0.09 USD per GB for the first 10 TB per month, cross-AZ transfer 0.01 USD per GB in each direction, S3 Standard about 0.023 USD per GB-month, S3 Glacier Deep Archive about 0.00099 USD per GB-month.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redirect responses:</strong> 100 million redirects per day with a response of about 500 bytes including headers is about 50 GB per day, roughly 1.5 TB per month, or about 135 USD per month of egress. Small.</li>\n<li><strong>Click events across zones:</strong> if each redirect writes a 300 byte event to a database primary in another availability zone, that is 30 GB per day crossing zones. With replication to a standby in a third zone, the bytes cross twice. At 0.01 USD per GB each way, the cost is a few tens of dollars per month, still small, but it grows linearly with any payload you add.</li>\n<li><strong>Event history storage:</strong> 100 million events per day at 300 bytes is about 30 GB per day, about 11 TB per year. Five years in S3 Standard would be about 55 TB, roughly 1,265 USD per month at the end. Moving events older than 90 days to Deep Archive brings the bulk of it to roughly 55 USD per month, at the cost of retrieval times measured in hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lesson: for this product, storage retention policy dominates, not the request path. For a video or image product, egress would dominate instead, which is why such products use CDNs with negotiated rates.</p>\n<h2>Cost levers and their trade-offs</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Lever</th><th>Typical saving</th><th>What you give up</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Reserved instances or savings plans</td><td>Often around 30 to 60% versus on-demand</td><td>One to three year commitment</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Spot or preemptible instances</td><td>Up to about 90% versus on-demand</td><td>Instances can be reclaimed with short notice (2 minutes on AWS)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storage lifecycle tiers</td><td>Large for cold data</td><td>Retrieval fees, minimum storage duration, slower access</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Zone-affine routing</td><td>Removes cross-AZ transfer</td><td>Uneven load if one zone is busier; failover must still work</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Compression and binary encoding</td><td>Often several times fewer bytes on the wire</td><td>CPU time and harder debugging</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CDN caching</td><td>Lower origin egress and compute</td><td>Staleness and invalidation complexity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Right-sizing and autoscaling</td><td>Removes idle capacity</td><td>Less headroom for sudden spikes</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Failure modes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Runaway costs from bugs:</strong> a retry loop or log flood can multiply the bill overnight; set budgets and billing alerts.</li>\n<li><strong>Unexpected NAT gateway charges:</strong> traffic from private subnets to AWS services through a NAT gateway is charged per GB processed; VPC endpoints avoid much of it.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheap storage, expensive reads:</strong> infrequent-access tiers charge per GB retrieved, so frequently read data can cost more there than in Standard.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

A service may meet its traffic target but fail the requirement to survive losing a host. You do not need to wait for a production outage to act on an explicit recovery requirement.</p>\n<p>For our shortener, the historical warm lookup measurement supports investigating a simple indexed database path.

Preserve a straightforward path to introduce it later.</p>\n<h3>Trace the new failure path</h3>\n<p>A cache can reduce database reads while creating a second place that serves an old answer. For short links, ask how quickly a disabled unsafe destination stops being returned. Also ask whether the database can handle the traffic when the cache is cold or unavailable.</p>\n<p>A queue can move report calculation out of a redirect's wait.

Include that work in the comparison even when the vendor offers a free tier.</p>\n<p>Before adopting the component, establish its owner, its failure signal, and the first recovery action. If nobody can investigate it during an incident, simplify the design or build that operating capability before relying on it.</p>\n<p>Deferring a component should leave a useful decision record.
