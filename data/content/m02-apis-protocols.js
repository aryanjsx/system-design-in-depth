It can evolve through additive, backward-compatible changes, but existing behaviour must not break. In distributed systems, breaking changes deployed to an API immediately cascade into client crashes, silent data corruption, or catastrophic transaction drops.</p>\n\n      <h2>The Life of an API Contract Across Lifecycles</h2>\n      <div class=\"mermaid\">\nflowchart TD\n    ClientApp[\"Mobile / Browser Client (v1.2.0)\"] -->|\"POST /v1/orders (Strict Schema)\"| APIGateway[\"API Gateway & Validation Filter\"]\n    APIGateway -->|\"Validate Payload against JSONSchema / Protobuf\"| SchemaCheck{\"Valid Schema?\"}\n    SchemaCheck -->|\"No\"| Err400[\"HTTP 400 Bad Request (RFC 9457 Problem Details)\"]\n    SchemaCheck -->|\"Yes\"| Route[\"Route to Service (gRPC / HTTP2)\"]\n    Route --> Service[\"Order Processing Engine\"]\n    Service -->|\"Idempotent Execution with Lock\"| DB[(\"Orders DB\")]\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Core Elements of Production-Grade API Contracts</h2>\n      <h3>1. Idempotency Key Semantics</h3>\n      <p>Network timeouts leave callers in an ambiguous state: did the server crash before executing the mutation, or was the response lost in flight? Non-idempotent mutating endpoints (typically <code>POST</code>, and <code>PATCH</code> when it is not naturally idempotent) should accept an <code>Idempotency-Key</code> header, an IETF draft (draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header) popularised by Stripe. The server records the key alongside the HTTP response within a single atomic database transaction. Retried requests with the identical key and a matching request body bypass business logic and replay the cached HTTP response; reusing a key with a different body is rejected as an error.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Backward Compatibility & Field Deprecation</h3>\n      <p>Never rename or change the type of an existing field. Follow the robustness principle (Postel's law): producers should be conservative in what they send, and consumers liberal in what they accept. The consumer side of this is the <strong>Tolerant Reader</strong> pattern: ignore unknown fields and read only what you need. New fields must be optional. Deprecated fields must remain populated through formal sunset timelines communicated via <code>Sunset: &lt;date&gt;</code> (RFC 8594) headers.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. Standardized Error Handling (RFC 9457 Problem Details)</h3>\n      <p>APIs should return uniform machine-readable error responses containing a <code>type</code> URI, human-readable <code>title</code>, HTTP <code>status</code>, granular <code>detail</code>, and a correlation <code>instance</code> trace ID to eliminate ambiguous ad-hoc client parsing.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: evolving a create-link endpoint</h2>\n<p>Version 1 of the shortener API is <code>POST /v1/links</code> with body <code>{\"url\": \"https://example.com/a\"}</code> returning <code>201 Created</code> and <code>{\"code\": \"Ab3xY9\", \"url\": \"...\"}</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe change:</strong> add an optional <code>expires_at</code> request field and a new <code>created_at</code> response field. Old clients ignore <code>created_at</code> (if they are tolerant readers) and never send <code>expires_at</code>, so their behaviour is unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Breaking changes:</strong> renaming <code>url</code> to <code>destination</code>, making <code>expires_at</code> required, changing the code length that clients validate with a regex, or returning 200 instead of 201. Each needs either a new version or a migration period where both forms are accepted.</p>\n<p><strong>Retry safety:</strong> the client sends <code>Idempotency-Key: 5f2c...</code>. The server stores the key, a hash of the request body and the final response in the same transaction as the link insert. A retry with the same key and body returns the stored response; the same key with a different body returns an error (for example 422) so accidental key reuse is detected. Keys expire after a retention window, for example 24 hours at Stripe.</p>\n<h2>Compatibility rules at a glance</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Change</th><th>Usually safe?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Add optional request field</td><td>Yes</td><td>Server must supply a sensible default</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Add response field</td><td>Yes, for tolerant clients</td><td>Strict deserializers that reject unknown fields will break</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Add new enum value</td><td>Risky</td><td>Clients with exhaustive switch statements may crash; document that enums can grow</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Remove or rename field</td><td>No</td><td>Deprecate, keep populating, announce with a Sunset header, then remove in a new version</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Make optional field required</td><td>No</td><td>Old clients never send it</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Change field type or units</td><td>No</td><td>Add a new field instead</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tighten validation</td><td>No</td><td>Previously accepted requests start failing</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard building blocks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Errors:</strong> RFC 9457 Problem Details (which obsoletes RFC 7807) defines a JSON error body with <code>type</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>detail</code> and <code>instance</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Deprecation:</strong> the <code>Sunset</code> header (RFC 8594) announces when a resource will stop working; the <code>Deprecation</code> header (RFC 9745) signals that it is deprecated now.</li>\n<li><strong>Idempotency:</strong> the <code>Idempotency-Key</code> header is an IETF draft, popularised by Stripe; many providers implement it.</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning:</strong> URL versions (<code>/v1</code>) are simple and visible; Stripe uses dated versions pinned per account with a request header to override, translating responses between versions internally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Failure modes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Idempotency record written outside the business transaction: a crash between the two lets a retry perform the action twice.</li>\n<li>Concurrent retries with the same key both running: lock on the key or insert it first with an in-progress status.</li>\n<li>Deprecation announced but never measured: log which clients still call old fields before removing them.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

Distributed Context & Deadline Propagation</h3>\n      <p>Every inbound user request must receive a unique W3C Trace Context (<code>traceparent</code>) and an absolute client deadline (e.g., <code>grpc-timeout: 500m</code>). If an upstream client specifies a 500ms timeout, and service A spends 450ms processing, downstream calls from service A to service B must only receive the remaining 50ms deadline. Continuing to execute downstream work after an upstream caller has already disconnected wastes CPU and database connections.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Bounded Connection Pools and Keep-Alive</h3>\n      <p>Creating TCP/TLS handshakes for every inter-service call introduces substantial latency overhead. Production services maintain persistent connection pools with HTTP/2 multiplexing or TCP keep-alive, strictly bounding max connections to avoid overwhelming downstream servers with connection spikes.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: deadline budget across a call chain</h2>\n<p>A user request enters the API with a 1,000 ms deadline. The API calls the order service, which calls inventory and then pricing sequentially.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API spends 50 ms on auth and parsing, then calls order with a remaining deadline of 950 ms.</li>\n<li>Order spends 30 ms, calls inventory. Inventory normally answers in 20 ms but is overloaded and hangs.</li>\n<li><strong>Without propagation:</strong> order uses a fixed 2 s client timeout to inventory. The user's request fails at 1,000 ms, but order keeps a thread and a connection blocked for another 1 s, and inventory keeps working on a request nobody wants. Under load, this wasted work is what exhausts thread pools.</li>\n<li><strong>With propagation:</strong> order passes the remaining 920 ms. gRPC does this automatically by sending the <code>grpc-timeout</code> header; each hop subtracts elapsed time. When the deadline passes, every hop cancels its work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good rule is to set each hop's timeout to the smaller of its own latency target (for example p99.9 plus margin) and the remaining caller deadline.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a style</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Need</th><th>Synchronous (HTTP or gRPC)</th><th>Asynchronous (queue or log)</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Caller needs the result to respond</td><td>Natural fit</td><td>Awkward; needs request/reply correlation</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Downstream may be down for minutes</td><td>Caller fails too unless it has a fallback</td><td>Messages wait in the broker</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Traffic bursts</td><td>Downstream must absorb the burst in real time</td><td>Broker buffers; consumers work at their own pace</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Many consumers of one fact</td><td>Caller must call each one</td><td>Publish once; each subscriber reads independently</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Debugging</td><td>Single trace, simple to follow</td><td>Needs correlation IDs across producer and consumer</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery semantics</td><td>Caller knows success or timeout (ambiguous)</td><td>At-least-once; duplicates and reordering possible</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Mechanics that matter</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connection reuse:</strong> a new TCP plus TLS 1.3 connection costs at least 2 round trips before the first byte of the request. Pooled keep-alive connections or HTTP/2 multiplexing avoid this per call.</li>\n<li><strong>Bounded pools:</strong> cap connections per destination so a slow dependency cannot absorb all of a caller's threads (the bulkhead pattern).</li>\n<li><strong>Trace context:</strong> propagate the W3C <code>traceparent</code> header on calls and in message headers so one request can be followed through queues.</li>\n<li><strong>Transactional outbox:</strong> to update a database and publish an event without losing either, write the event to an outbox table in the same transaction and have a relay publish it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How real systems do it</h2>\n<p>Google's internal RPC system (Stubby, the predecessor of gRPC) made deadline propagation a default. Uber, Netflix and LinkedIn use Kafka for asynchronous fan-out of events such as trips, plays and profile updates, while keeping request/response RPC for user-facing reads.</p>\n</div>",

TCP Reliability & Head-of-Line (HoL) Blocking</h3>\n      <p>TCP abstracts network packets into a continuous, reliable byte stream. To achieve this, it implements sequence numbering, acknowledgments (ACKs), automatic retransmission (ARQ), and dynamic sliding window flow control. However, if packet #2 is dropped in flight, the receiver's operating system kernel buffers packets #3, #4, and #5 in memory without delivering them to the application until packet #2 is retransmitted. This is <strong>TCP Head-of-Line Blocking</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. UDP: Low-Overhead Datagrams</h3>\n      <p>UDP adds only an 8-byte header (Source Port, Destination Port, Length, Checksum) on top of IP. There is no connection state, no handshake, no ACK, and no congestion backoff. If a packet drops, the application never pauses. This makes UDP the foundation for real-time multiplayer gaming, VoIP (WebRTC), DNS queries, and live interactive media over RTP. On-demand video streaming (HLS/DASH) instead runs over HTTP on TCP or QUIC.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. The Modern Synthesis: QUIC (HTTP/3 over UDP)</h3>\n      <p>HTTP/3 replaces TCP with the <strong>QUIC protocol</strong>, which runs over UDP and is typically (though not necessarily) implemented in user space. QUIC implements multiple independent byte streams inside a single UDP connection: dropping a packet on stream A stalls stream A, while streams B, C, and D continue unaffected: head-of-line blocking is confined to the stream that lost data.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: what a handshake costs</h2>\n<p>A mobile user is 80 ms round-trip time (RTT) from the server.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TCP plus TLS 1.3, new connection:</strong> 1 RTT for the TCP handshake plus 1 RTT for TLS, then the HTTP request needs 1 more RTT for the response: about 240 ms before the first byte of the response.</li>\n<li><strong>TCP plus TLS 1.2:</strong> TLS 1.2 needs 2 RTTs, so about 320 ms.</li>\n<li><strong>QUIC (HTTP/3), new connection:</strong> transport and TLS 1.3 handshakes are combined into 1 RTT, then 1 RTT for the response: about 160 ms. On a resumed connection, 0-RTT lets the request go in the first flight, about 80 ms, with the caveat that 0-RTT data can be replayed, so it should only carry idempotent requests.</li>\n<li><strong>UDP for DNS:</strong> one query datagram and one response, about 80 ms, no connection at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now add loss. With 2% packet loss on a video call over TCP, each loss stalls delivery of later data for at least one RTT while the segment is retransmitted, causing visible freezes.

Always picking the globally least-loaded node needs fresh shared state and causes herding when many balancers act on the same stale view. Instead, the load balancer picks <strong>two random nodes</strong> and routes to whichever has the lower Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) latency. Mathematically, P2C cuts the expected maximum load from about log n / log log n (random choice) to about log log n, with O(1) computation: it greatly reduces hot spots, though it is not optimal.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: why random is not good enough, and two choices is</h2>\n<p>Suppose 1,000 servers each receive requests at random. If you throw n requests at n servers uniformly at random, the busiest server's load grows like log n / log log n. That is only a leading-order estimate (it evaluates to about 3.6 for n = 1,000); in simulation the busiest of 1,000 servers typically gets 5 or 6 requests while the average is 1. If instead each request samples two random servers and picks the less loaded, the maximum grows only as log log n / log 2 plus a constant, typically 3 for n = 1,000. This is the \"power of two choices\" result from Azar, Broder, Karlin and Upfal (1994) and Mitzenmacher's thesis (1996). Sampling more than two gives only small further gains.</p>\n<p>It matters in practice because a central \"least loaded\" choice needs fresh global state. Many independent load balancer instances each picking the globally least-loaded server all pick the same one (herding). Two random choices use only local, slightly stale information yet avoid herding.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm comparison</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Algorithm</th><th>State needed</th><th>Handles uneven request cost</th><th>Good for</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Round robin</td><td>A counter</td><td>Poorly</td><td>Uniform, short requests on identical servers</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted round robin</td><td>Counter and weights</td><td>Poorly</td><td>Mixed instance sizes</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Least connections or outstanding requests</td><td>Active count per backend</td><td>Well</td><td>Variable request duration, long-lived connections</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Power of two choices on load</td><td>Local counts or latency estimates</td><td>Well</td><td>Many distributed balancers, large pools</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Peak EWMA latency with P2C</td><td>Latency average per backend</td><td>Well, and reacts to slow nodes</td><td>Client-side balancing (Finagle, Linkerd)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Hash (source IP, key, consistent hash)</td><td>Hash ring</td><td>No</td><td>Stickiness and cache locality</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Health checking details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Active checks:</strong> the balancer calls <code>/healthz</code> every few seconds; typical settings mark a node down after 2 to 3 failures and up after 2 successes.</li>\n<li><strong>Passive checks (outlier detection):</strong> eject a backend that returns several consecutive 5xx responses to real traffic, as Envoy does.</li>\n<li><strong>Panic threshold:</strong> if too many nodes look unhealthy (for example over 50%), send traffic to all of them rather than overload the few remaining; Envoy implements this.</li>\n<li><strong>Connection draining:</strong> when removing a node, stop new requests but let in-flight ones finish.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How real systems do it</h2>\n<p>Google's Maglev is a software L4 balancer that runs on commodity servers and uses consistent hashing so that connections survive balancer failover.

Kafka Producer Batching (`linger.ms` and `batch.size`)</h3>\n      <p>Apache Kafka achieves millions of messages per second on commodity hardware through batching combined with sequential disk I/O, the OS page cache and zero-copy transfers. The producer library holds records in a memory buffer. It flushes when either <code>batch.size</code> (e.g., 16KB) is reached OR <code>linger.ms</code> (e.g., 10ms) expires. Setting <code>linger.ms = 5</code> adds up to 5ms of delay but can raise throughput substantially under load, because requests carry fuller and better-compressed batches; the gain depends on record size and rate. Kafka 4.0 (KIP-1030) changed the default from 0 to 5 ms.</p>\n\n      <h3>2. Partial Batch Failure Semantics</h3>\n      <p>When sending a batch of 500 records to an upstream service, individual records may fail (e.g., a validation error on record #42). Production batch APIs should return granular per-item statuses rather than failing the entire batch, preventing infinite redelivery loops. Note that a single multi-row SQL <code>INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...)</code> is atomic: a duplicate key on one row fails the whole statement unless you use <code>ON CONFLICT</code> or per-row handling.</p>\n    \n<!-- enriched -->\n<h2>Worked example: inserting click events</h2>\n<p>The shortener must store 1,200 click events per second on average.

Netflix's open-source concurrency-limits library implements <strong>Adaptive Concurrency Limits</strong> based on TCP congestion-control ideas such as Vegas and on Little's Law (L = λ W).

Capacity is therefore 100 / 0.05 = 2,000 requests per second.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offered 3,000 per second, no shedding, unbounded queue:</strong> the queue grows by 1,000 per second. After a few seconds, queueing delay passes 1 s, so requests are served only after their client has already given up. The server stays 100% busy but goodput (successful, in-time responses) can fall toward zero. This is congestion collapse.</li>\n<li><strong>Offered 3,000 per second with a queue-time limit:</strong> reject any request that has waited more than, say, 200 ms, or cap in-flight plus queued work at about 400. Now roughly 2,000 per second succeed within the deadline and 1,000 per second get a fast 503. Goodput stays at capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>With priorities:</strong> if 30% of traffic is batch or prefetch requests, shedding those first means user-facing requests (2,100 per second) are almost all served.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Little's law ties this together: in-flight requests = throughput x latency. At 2,000 per second and a 50 ms target, only about 100 requests should be in flight. A concurrency limit near that number is a direct way to protect latency.</p>\n<h2>Adaptive concurrency limits</h2>\n<p>Netflix's open-source concurrency-limits library adjusts the allowed in-flight count using ideas from TCP congestion control (for example Vegas and Gradient algorithms): it tracks the minimum observed latency as the no-queue baseline, and when measured latency rises above it, queueing has started and the limit is reduced; when latency is at the baseline, the limit probes upward. Requests over the limit are rejected immediately.</p>\n<h2>Strategy table</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Technique</th><th>What it protects</th><th>Trade-off</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Per-client rate limiting (token bucket)</td><td>Fairness between clients</td><td>Does not reflect the server's actual capacity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Static concurrency limit</td><td>Worker pool and memory</td><td>Needs retuning as the service changes</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Adaptive concurrency limit</td><td>Latency near its no-queue baseline</td><td>Can oscillate; needs good latency signals</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Queue time deadline (drop requests that waited too long)</td><td>Wasted work on requests clients abandoned</td><td>Requires request arrival timestamps</td></tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO or CoDel-style queueing under overload</td><td>Fresh requests still succeed</td><td>Old requests starve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Criticality-based shedding</td><td>Business-critical traffic</td><td>Requires tagging every request</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Degraded responses (cached or partial)</td><td>User experience</td><td>Stale or incomplete data</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Failure modes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expensive rejections:</strong> if rejecting still requires TLS handshake, logging and auth, a flood can overload the server anyway; shed as early as possible, even at the load balancer.</li>\n<li><strong>Health checks shed too:</strong> if health checks are rejected, the load balancer marks nodes unhealthy and sends even more traffic to the survivors. Exempt them.</li>\n<li><strong>Metastable states:</strong> retries and cold caches can keep the system overloaded after the trigger ends; combine shedding with retry budgets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How real systems do it</h2>\n<p>Google tags RPCs with criticality levels (for example CRITICAL_PLUS, CRITICAL, SHEDDABLE_PLUS, SHEDDABLE), as described in the SRE book's chapter on handling overload. Amazon services reject excess work early and measure goodput separately from throughput. Facebook uses adaptive LIFO and CoDel-style queue management in its RPC servers so that under overload recent requests still succeed.</p>\n</div>",
