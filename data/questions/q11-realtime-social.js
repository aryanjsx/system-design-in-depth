    "options": [
      "Redis buffers them per channel until the node acknowledges them, so only acknowledgements need to be tuned",
      "They are missed, because Pub/Sub is fire-and-forget; the client must resume from its last acknowledged position in a durable store",
      "The load balancer's sticky session replays them once the phone reconnects to the same node",
      "They are queued in the node's outbound buffer indefinitely, so the fix is simply a larger per-socket queue"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Ephemeral Pub/Sub only reaches subscribers that are listening right now, so durability has to come from per-conversation or per-recipient positions the client resumes from.

    "prompt": "You size a count-min sketch with epsilon = 0.0001 and delta = 0.01, and a trending window holds 20 million tag events. What are the approximate width and the maximum overcount (with probability 0.99)?",
    "options": [
      "Width about 27,183; overcount at most about 200",

      "Width about 27,183; overcount at most about 2,000"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Width is ceil(e / epsilon) = ceil(2.71828 / 0.0001) = 27,183, and the error bound is epsilon x N = 0.0001 x 20M = 2,000 counts. The option with 200 applies the right width but slips a factor of ten on epsilon x N, which matters when you decide whether small tags can be ranked reliably.",
