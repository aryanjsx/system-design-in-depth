    "options": [
      "A presigned PUT can sign a content-length range, so S3 rejects anything over 5 MB",
      "A presigned PUT cannot express a size range; use a presigned POST with content-length-range, and verify size afterwards",
      "Size limits are enforced by the expiry timestamp, since a short URL cannot carry a large upload",
      "Signing the Content-Type header also caps the upload size for that media type"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A presigned PUT binds key, method, expiry and any signed headers; signing Content-Length pins one exact length, not a range, so a POST policy with content-length-range plus post-upload verification is the right tool.

    "options": [

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Without a license, a player can fetch encrypted segments but has no usable key, so new sessions fail even though the CDN is fine; multi-region licensing, cached entitlement and persistent licenses reduce the blast radius. Adding a CDN is the tempting reflex, but segment delivery was never the problem.",
