    "options": [
      "Traffic, because the queue growth means demand has risen",

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Saturation measures how close the most constrained resource (here the thread pool) is to its limit, and it is the leading indicator before latency and errors degrade. Latency is tempting, but it is still normal; it is the lagging symptom that saturation predicts.",
