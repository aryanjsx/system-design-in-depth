    "options": [
      "Return it, because the index already proved it lies inside the covering",

      "Drop it in the exact filter step, because a stale location fails the freshness cutoff"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The index only generates a bounded candidate set; the exact step then filters by geodesic distance, availability, permissions and a freshness cutoff, so geometric closeness does not make a stale courier eligible.

Roughly how many candidates does each covering return, and how many are real hits?",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "171 x 200 is about 34,000 and 29 x 200 about 5,800, while the circle is only 12.6 square km, so about 2,500 places are truly within 2 km either way.

      "The false-positive rate stays near 1 percent, because the hash count was fixed at sizing time",
      "The filter starts producing false negatives, so seen items reappear in the feed",

      "The false-positive rate rises linearly to about 3 percent, which is still acceptable"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "At three times capacity only about 3.2 bits per item remain, and with 7 hashes the false-positive rate is (1 - e^-2.19)^7, roughly 40 percent, so the error climbs far faster than linearly. That is why the lesson says to monitor insert count and rotate or rebuild; false negatives still cannot occur.",

    "options": [
      "The feature is computed after the recommendation, so it leaks the label and cannot be reproduced at serving time",
      "The feature is too sparse for a deep model, so it should be moved into candidate generation instead",

      "Offline evaluation measures recall, while production measures precision, so gains never transfer"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Features must be available at serving time; an outcome observed after the recommendation leaks the label, producing offline wins production cannot reproduce. Version mismatch is a real risk the lesson mentions, but it would not explain a gain that exists only because of a post-outcome feature.",

    "prompt": "In the lesson's 150 ms pipeline (retrieval 20 ms, filtering 5 ms, ranking 60 ms for 800 candidates, re-ranking 5 ms), a new ranker needs about 120 ms for 800 candidates, scaling roughly linearly with batch size. What is the most sensible way to keep the p99 budget?",

      "Remove the Bloom filter and exact seen checks to free enough time for the new ranker",
      "Drop the re-ranking stage and exploration slots, which recovers the needed time",

      "Replace ANN with exact nearest neighbour search so fewer candidates need ranking"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Filtering and re-ranking together take only 10 ms, so dropping them cannot absorb a 60 ms overrun; halving the ranked set restores ranking to about 60 ms and keeps the remaining budget for network hops and feature reads. Exact nearest neighbour search is far slower than ANN and would blow the retrieval budget.",

    "options": [
      "Increase exploration slots so the ranker learns faster which profiles are popular",
      "Cap exposure for very popular profiles and rank on mutual-interest likelihood rather than one-sided attractiveness",

      "Shrink the geospatial radius so each popular profile is shown to fewer nearby viewers"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Two-sided markets must balance attention, so systems cap exposure and optimise for mutual interest instead of one-sided appeal. The Elo option is tempting because it sounds like balancing, but the lesson notes Tinder moved away from Elo-style desirability toward models of mutual activity and preferences.",
