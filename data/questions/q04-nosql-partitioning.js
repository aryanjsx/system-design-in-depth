    "prompt": "A teammate argues: 'We should move to NoSQL because SQL databases use B-trees and NoSQL uses LSM trees, so NoSQL is faster for writes.' What is the core flaw in this reasoning?",
    "options": [
      "It is correct in principle, but only MongoDB and Cassandra actually use LSM trees today",
      "The SQL versus NoSQL label does not determine the storage engine; relational and non-relational products each use B-trees, heaps or LSM trees",
      "LSM trees are slower for writes than B-trees, so the conclusion is backwards",
      "Storage engines only affect reads, so they are irrelevant to a write-throughput decision"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The lesson stresses that SQL versus NoSQL is not B-tree versus LSM: Postgres uses heap tables with indexes, InnoDB a clustered B+ tree, and LSM engines appear on both sides. Saying LSM is slower for writes is wrong; LSM trees generally favour writes, the mistake is tying engine to category.",
